# prtweeter

This is a commandline App to poll a specified github repository for
new pull request, and tweet a summary for each one on a twitter
account.

## Installation

Clone via

    $ git clone git@github.com:bitti/pr-tweeter.git

build with [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org) via

    $ cd pr-tweeter
    $ lein uberjar

and move the resulting jar

    target/uberjar/prtweeter-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar

to an appropriate location.

## Usage

You can just use the `lein run` command in the source directory. If
you prefer to use the jar you can use the `java` command

    $ java -jar prtweeter-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar

On some systems like Linux you can also make the jar executable

    $ chmod +x prtweeter-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar

and start it like any other executable in a terminal. (It's not
advisible to just click the jar in a graphical environment, the App is
expecting a commandline environment.)

On first start you'll be asked for necessary configuration parameters.
These are a github username and repository (which don't have to be
yours, since only github read access is needed) and OAuth credentials
for your Twitter account. To get these you need to create a "Twitter
App" at https://apps.twitter.com/app/new for your twitter account.

To avoid spamming your account by default a maximum of 5 tweets per
run is generated. You can change this default and other options by
changing the configuration as explained in the extended documentation
in [doc/intro.md](doc/intro.md).

## Options

### Bugs

There is a theoretical chance for a race condition when two pull
requests are opened at the same time when prtweeter is running. In
this case one pull request might not get posted even on a rerun. Let
me know if you ever encounter this.
